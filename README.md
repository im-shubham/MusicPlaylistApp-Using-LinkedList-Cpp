<h1>Music Playlist Console App Using Linked List C++ </h1>

<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<br><br>
The Music Playlist app is a program that allows users to create and manage their own music playlist. The app uses a linked list data structure to store information about each song in the playlist, including the song's title, artist, and duration. With this app, users can add new songs to their playlist, remove songs from their playlist, and play their entire playlist in sequence.

Remove songs: Users can remove songs from their playlist by specifying the index of the song they want to remove. The app will traverse the linked list to find the specified song and remove it from the list.<br><br><hr>
Play playlist: Users can play their entire playlist in sequence by selecting the "play" option from the app menu. The app will iterate through the linked list and display information about each song as it is played.<br><br><hr>

<h3>Implementation:</h3>
The Music Playlist app is implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming techniques.<br><br>
The app uses a  linked list data structure to store information about each song in the playlist. <br><br>
